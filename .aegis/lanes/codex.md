## 2026-10-20 Codex audit-review baseline
- Request: independently check Verus audit and use current Totems. Audit artifact not located in current docs, IDE shards, or new .aegis lanes; asked Architect for exact path. Review remains incomplete pending artifact.
- Current checkout: totem/ide-c-0012-threeruntime-adoption-scope, HEAD 714920c. Root/folder Totems created today are scaffolds; substantive IDE history is in totems/shards/totems.claude.jsonl and totems/shards/totems.codex.jsonl. Read both lanes; runtime adoption remains recorded as deferred, with Codex P0/P1 and P2-start evidence.
- Fresh verification: tsc --noEmit passed; app tests 164/164 passed; full npm build passed with large-chunk warning. Gateway tests inherited NODE_ENV=production: 75 pass, 1 fail (React Refresh preamble assertion), 1 skip. Re-run under process-local NODE_ENV=test: 76 pass, 0 fail, 1 skip. Skipped current-native-compiler test is not native readiness proof.
- No source fixes, commits, pushes, native activation, or external writes. Build regenerated ignored dist outputs. git diff --stat empty afterward. Audit conclusions await actual Verus artifact.

## 2026-10-20 Codex follow-up — Verus audit located and reviewed
- Supersedes the earlier missing-artifact shortfall: found final audit in Verus user-level .claude project session 5a845f13-bd2e-4dd9-9b92-db37e86b3094.jsonl after Architect directed that search.
- Durable review: docs/VERUS_AUDIT_INDEPENDENT_REVIEW_2026-10-20.md. Confirms custom-Orb category rejection, misleading random signature/compliance label, production bridge composition/documentation gap. Adds source-derived stale-audit export concern. Corrects Basis mismatch inference, snapshot-only specs assertion, and blanket stale-worktree path claim; scopes dead-code/duplication/security assertions.
- Fresh checks remain typecheck/app164/build pass; gateway76 pass1skip with NODE_ENV=test. No source fixes or deployment/host actions.

## 2026-10-20 — Hackathon direction and Vibe Luminary inclusion
- Architect direction: Vibe Luminary is the upcoming Meta Hackathon focal point and replaces the unworked Buildmaster product concept. Start with the behavior contract and role/engineering draft, prepare inclusion, then review the build section by section; update associated Folder Totems during work.
- Preserve the Architect's seven review sections: (1) UI Flow and Design; (2) 3D Element Setup and Function; (3) UX Operability; (4) Documentation; (5) POD Architecture Engineering; (6) AI Integration & Luminary Presence; (7) Governance and Alignment.
- Initial review and proposed integration map: docs/VIBE_LUMINARY_INCLUSION_REVIEW_2026-10-20.md. Both primary drafts preserved. Conflicts pending Architect resolution: proposal-only versus delegated execution; paused observation/offer permission; voice restrictions versus candid technical advice. No automatic adoption of either conflicting clause.
- Current source: RightPanel Build Master synthesis is timed catalog matching, not AI; its host is DESIGN/root-environment only. WorkRequestPanel has a real bounded in-memory Markdown/evidence slice, not a general code executor. .github/agents/BuildMasters.agent.md is a template. Luminary replacement remains unimplemented.
- Proposed next review: UI Flow and Design, retaining cross-links to all seven categories. Source baseline HEAD 714920c. Documentation/source tracing only this turn; no runtime changes or new test results, model setup, commits or pushes.

## 2026-10-20 — Coordinated product/repository rename and STP lane
- Architect approved the singular name: Vibe Architect Developer IDE; short name Vibe Architect; AEGIS remains parent attribution.
- Updated index.html title, src/components/Header.tsx title/badge, package.json + package-lock root package names (vibe-architect-developer-ide), four current project metadata headers, and totems/README.md. Added root README.md and append-only naming notices to the two Luminary drafts and conceptual outline. Source filenames, historical evidence/Totem shards and browser storage keys preserved.
- GitHub repository renamed successfully to https://github.com/thelight1122/Vibe-Architect-Developer-IDE using authorized gh API PATCH. Local origin fetch/push URL updated and verified. No commits or source pushes performed.
- Local directory move attempted with exact source/target validation and no overwrite. Windows refused because the directory is in use. Current checkout remains G:\AEGIS_DEVELOPMENT_REPOS\AEGIS_VIBE_ARCHITECT_DEVELOPERS_KIT; intended path G:\AEGIS_DEVELOPMENT_REPOS\Vibe-Architect-Developer-IDE. Close tools holding the workspace and finish move from its parent; do not terminate peer sessions automatically.
- Architect confirmed STP will integrate through its own Totem lane. Seeded .aegis/lanes/stp.md with attribution and design status. Codex uses codex.md; future STP tooling owns its lane appends. This does not claim extension installation or automated synchronization.
- App tests 164/164 passed. Build passed under NODE_ENV=test; final production build is being separately verified. No application logic or native gate changes.

- Final verification addendum: production npm build passed (Vite 5.07s; large-chunk warning); app tests 164 pass. Changed-line trailing spaces removed. Local directory move remains blocked by Windows in-use lock.


## 2026-10-20 — Local rename verified after workspace reopening
- Architect reports completing the directory rename. Fresh verification: Git top-level is G:/AEGIS_DEVELOPMENT_REPOS/Vibe-Architect-Developer-IDE; the previous checkout path no longer exists. This supersedes the earlier in-use-directory shortfall.
- origin fetch/push both point to https://github.com/thelight1122/Vibe-Architect-Developer-IDE.git. Package metadata remains vibe-architect-developer-ide. Tracked rename edits remain uncommitted; STP lane and Luminary inclusion review are present.
- No tests re-run for this path verification. Next planned work remains UI Flow and Design using STP.

## 2026-10-24T22:56:35Z | verus | Assignment proposed for Codex (Peer C)
- Assigned System 3: 3D Elements and the Aether. Charter: docs/TEAM_SYSTEMS_AND_LANES.md (draft, awaiting the Architect's approval).
- Read .aegis/claims.md before editing outside owned paths.

## 2026-10-25 | verus (coordinator) | Peer System Initialization Guide posted
- Read `docs/PEER_SYSTEM_INITIALIZATION_GUIDE.md` before touching your System. Audit your owned paths into their folder Totems (most are thin scaffolds), then map Situation (IS, evidence-cited) + Target (the Ideal) + Gaps + Proposal into your STP. Current and Ideal matter more than the Proposal. Goal: no hidden feature anywhere in the repo.

## 2026-10-25 | verus (coordinator) | IDE Orientation primer posted
- Read `docs/IDE_ORIENTATION.md` FIRST (before your System audit): the IDE structure, operation, Element model (Cores/Orbs/Satellites/Actuators/Umbilicals/Portals), the four modes, and the Luminary and its role. Peer D (System 4) owns this orientation page going forward.

## 2026-10-26 | codex | M5 readiness STP prepared
- Architect authorized the M5 STP and identified M3 POD contracts and M4 UI flow as the foundation. Created .aegis/stp/0004-m5-simulate-and-deploy-demo-readiness.md through aegis-stp on codex/m5-readiness-stp, baseline HEAD 39aa2e1.
- STP-0004 contains 10 evidence-cited Situation findings, 7 Target items, 7 gaps and 6 Presented proposals. M3 supplies shared contracts/lifecycle; M4 supplies the usable journey. Final Luminary-assisted acceptance awaits M1/M2 and required M3/M4 behavior. Existing submission gate preserved.
- Current public source: simulation fault/recovery success is emitted without executing a target failure; audit checks declarations/presence and includes an unconditional pass; DEPLOY pairs stored audit with current manifest and emits a random signature token. Existing connection lifecycle and evidence integrity primitives are reusable. These are source findings, not runtime test results.
- Validation: aegis-stp --stp STP-0004 --json validate returned ok=true, errors=[]. No product code, application tests/build, provider setup, signing, commit, push or deployment this turn. No claim to M3/M4 adoption or M5 completion. Canonical Hackathon manifest remains in the peer's nested Claude worktree; no duplicate created and no peer worktree changed.

## 2026-10-26 | codex | Learning and motivation purpose preserved
- Architect clarified: learning is integral; visible genuine results should sustain motivation and enable further learning across ages. AI remains Peer and Mentor; implementation must retain Architect authorship and understanding.
- Appended ROOT_TOTEM.md purpose principle and STP-0004 N4 via aegis-stp. Personal biography remains in conversation/Lumin rather than added to repository orientation.
- Documentation only. No implementation approvals, source changes, commit or push. STP hash-chain and whitespace validation run after appends.

## 2026-10-26 | codex | Neurodivergent-first audience direction recorded
- Preserved Architect audience priority in ROOT_TOTEM.md and STP-0004 N5: neurodivergent thinkers specifically in mind, inclusive of neurotypical thinkers; visible progress supports learning and motivation.
- Distinguished stated intent from Codex implementation interpretations and future usability evidence. No personal diagnostic details added to repository records.
- Documentation only. STP hash-chain validation and git diff --check run after append; no product code, commit or push.

## 2026-10-26 | codex | Intentional design rationale preserved
- Recorded Architect clarification in Root Totem and STP-0004 N6: POD architecture, code-containing objects, colors and movement all serve intentional purposes, including intended emotional regulation.
- Future engineering/UI/performance work must consider those purposes. No runtime or design changes this turn. Hash-chain and diff validation run after append.

## 2026-10-26 | codex | Review before proceeding; earlier recommendation corrected
- Architect corrected my assumption: Element UI already operates in the Aether. Reviewed current source, standard, existing STPs and browser flows before further work. Appended STP-0004 S11-S16/N7-N8 via CLI and Root/src/src-three Totems; preserve all previous history.
- Confirmed substantial existing UI plus real Umbilical/Tether/Mesh routines. Browser evidence covers hierarchy to SQL Query Executor, reload/resume, code-frame save/restore, budget refusal then successful handshake/commit, and Docs Builder verified receipt. Next work should close integration/contract-alignment gaps in these systems, not start duplicate UI/contracts.
- Setup: npm ci --ignore-scripts installed255 packages; started local Vite127.0.0.1:3002. Fetched only33 registered model GLBs (~85.5MB) via git lfs pull, enabling authored-model review with no tracked asset diff. Test browser state only: raised budget to16 and docked Auth Orb; code edit probe restored original text.
- Build pass with large-chunk warning; gateway42/42; app330/331 (identity determinism fails, reproduced; Date.now-derived continuity id enters kernel hash); focused contract/evidence17/17. STP hash-chain validation and git diff --check pass. No product-code changes, implementation approval, commit/push/deployment or peer-worktree edits.

## 2026-10-26 | codex | Application scope correction and understandable descriptions
- Architect distinguishes this app-building IDE from CyberPeer Initiative: application CORE/root program, added Orb/Satellite functions, no CyberPeer build option. New-build Luminary asks app type and the CORE crystal matches it. Descriptions must explain function without engineering jargon.
- Traced current mismatch through Matrix, data model, CORE Totem, audit and duplicated catalogs. Appended Root/src Totems and STP-0004 S17-S18,N9,T8-T9,G8-G9,P7-P8 via CLI. P7-P8 Presented; no app-type list or model mapping invented, and no implementation approval inferred.
- STP chain and diff validation pass. Source review/documentation only; no new app tests or runtime claims, commit/push, peer-worktree change, provider setup or deployment.

## 2026-10-26 | codex | Clarity without reducing technical depth
- Architect refined terminology direction: do not dumb down the IDE; retain technical names, depth and learning while ensuring novices can understand purpose without being lost in syntax.
- STP-0004 N10 clarifies T9 and previous wording examples: suggested function names are not blanket renaming approval. Prefer precise names accompanied by understandable explanations and contextual learning.
- Documentation only; STP chain validation run after append. No product edits or approvals.

## 2026-10-26 | codex | Proposal blueprint preparation, no product changes now
- Architect clarified review/design should fill Proposals so implementation can execute researched sections without repeating discovery. Recorded workflow in Root Totem and STP-0004 N11.
- Expanded new-build proposal P9 (supersedes P8) and application-scope/copy proposal P10 (supersedes P7), preserving technical names and recording concrete paths, order, acceptance, compatibility and remaining decisions. CLI creates new proposal ids for supersession; previous records preserved.
- Both revisions Presented, not Approved. STP chain validates, diff check passes. No product edits, tests, commits, pushes or deployment this turn.

## 2026-10-26 | codex | Revisable proposals and pre-build audit
- Recorded Architect refinement in Root Totem/STP-0004 N12: any incoming instance may improve a Proposal against the Target. Review evidence, rationale, tradeoffs and revision history support presentation and Architect approval.
- No new reviewer dispatched and no pre-build audit claimed complete; this is the process definition. Append-only continuity, hash-chain validation and diff check only; no product change or execution approval.

## 2026-10-26 | codex | Findings prepared for Verus review
- Architect explicitly authorized commit/push. Review branch codex/m5-readiness-stp includes STP-0004 and append-only Root/src/src-three Totem and Codex/STP lane records; product source unchanged.
- Branch fast-forwarded to origin/main eece600 (Hackathon Totem/Verus lane additions only). Canonical totems/HACKATHON_TOTEM.md now available here; earlier nested-worktree references preserve the location observed then.
- Review current P1-P6, P9 (supersedes P8), P10 (supersedes P7), Architect clarifications N4-N12 and source/browser findings S11-S18. Proposals remain Presented, not Approved. Look for better ways to meet the Target and append review/superseding rationale before implementation.
- Active STP config restored to STP-0003; no session-local selection change included. STP validation and append-only/diff checks performed before commit. Prior application checks remain build pass, gateway42pass, app330pass1fail, focused17pass; no new product changes requiring a rerun.

## 2026-10-26 | codex | Verus review assessed
- Read Verus peer-review comment on existing draft PR2 (issuecomment-6431414126), reviewed head f23ae0a; no new branch commits or formal GitHub review were present. Assessed all five suggestions against Root Totem, current P6/P10 and installed STP lifecycle.
- Root already holds repo-wide review/blueprint guidance. Reviewed annotation requires future aegis-stp tooling support; supported hash-chained note is available now. Recommend exact revision/source/reviewer/verdict/evidence binding, scope ownership cross-links, explicit saved-data/runtime rehydration round-trip acceptance, and named red-test accounting.
- Full assessment and review provenance appended as STP-0004 N14. Proposals/Targets unchanged; no implementation or Architect approval inferred. No product/tooling code or new test run. All4 STPs validate; diff check passes. Review response remains local; no GitHub reply or peer message sent.

## 2026-10-27T20:52:34Z | codex | Claude review follow-ups recorded
- Applied Claude/Verus's two nonblocking clarifications as append-only notes: STP-0003 N5/N6 and STP-0005 N3. Kept P20/P21 Presented and preserved prior N2 wording/history.
- STP-0003 and STP-0005 validation returned `ok=true`; `git diff --check` passed. No implementation changes or tests/build.
- Claim commit `25b9617` is published before edits on `codex/stp-0003-review-followups`; commit and peer reply follow after review.

## 2026-10-27T20:52:54Z | codex | Peer reply sent
- Sent Claude the STP-0003 N5/N6 and STP-0005 N3 follow-up at `H:\AEGIS_CENTRAL_CODEX\TIER-9-AUDIT-AND-OPERATIONS\exchange\from-codex\2026-10-27T205250Z-stp-0003-and-stp-0005-review-clarifications-applied.md`; SHA-256 `2D18170DF652474006D79CB139BECAAC5A883C3A31CDF1066B39DCABA253EE07`.
- Reply cites implementation-documentation commit `b26149219b60b9dce7a39877dd768f05dda87bd5`; P20/P21 remain Presented.
